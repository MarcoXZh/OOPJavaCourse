# Assignment 6: Test Driven Development

  - Source code: [*TDD*][Code1].


This assignment will provide you with a comprehensive set of test cases; similar to those provided in the assignment 4.
This set of test cases outlines the beginning of a "Musical Jukebox" program. The test cases provided in the assignment
specify two classes `Song` and `Playlist`. The `Playlist` class is implementing a generic playlist to improve its
applicability in order to handle any types of elements. Your assignment is to implement the functionality defined by the
test cases provided. This assignment will utilize a number of Java concepts, including polymorphism, generics and method
overriding or redefining. The assignment contains 19 test cases, divided over two classes -- `SongTest` and
`PlaylistTest`. The class `AllTests` is a test suite that contains the previous two test classes. These test cases are
to be used to drive the development of the two classes `Song` and `Playlist`. Finally, you will be asked to **create two
new test cases** that would provide a basis for two new methods inside of the `Playlist` class that would sort the play
list by artist, and by title.

It is important to note that you only need to implement the functionality needed to PASS the test cases. Remember to try
and "keep it simple"!
