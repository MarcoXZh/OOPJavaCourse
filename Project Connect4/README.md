# Project: The Connect4 Game

Traditionally, many families have spent their evenings playing board games; today, one potential money making strategy
is to computerize these games and to sell them to a new generation. To increase the probability of capturing a
reasonable market share, our electronic media designer continually ponders the question: "What additional
characteristics or features could a computerized version possess that could differentiate it from the original tactile
version?" The project is to produce a computerized version of the game: Connect4. One obvious answer, to the question of
adding features, is a computerized opponent(s) for individuals lacking playing partners. A second obvious answer is to
add variations on the basic theme; for example, as well as playing Connect4, the system should also play OTTO and TOOT.
This new game is the same as Connect4, except one player places "O" counters and one player places "T" counters; and one
player wins by connecting 4 counters spelling "OTTO" and the other by connecting 4 counters spelling "TOOT". Our company
expects to produce a number of games upon this basic theme, and hence, you are required to design your game to "allow it
to be efficiently and effectively extended"; a quote from our CEO.


As stated above, the project is to produce a computerized version of the game: Connect4 and its variations, both
specified ("TOOT" and "OTTO") and unspecified ("to be efficiently and effectively extended"). This new version should
seek to exploit the differences between this new implementation medium and the traditional or original medium.


To assist you with this task, please ponder (and answer) the following questions as you go ...

1.  What can we do on a computer than we can't do on a printed board?
2.  What is a computerized opponent? Remember, not everyone is an expert.

    - What are its objectives?
    - What characteristics should it possess?
    - Do we need an opponent or opponents?

3. What design choices exist for the Interface components? Colour? Font? Dimensions of Windows? Rescale-ability? Scroll
   Bars? ...
4. What does exception handling mean in a GUI system?
5. Do we require a command-line interface for debugging purposes????? The answer is yes by the way – please explain why.
6. What components do Connect4 and "OTTO and TOOT" have in common?

    - How do we take advantage of this commonality in our OO design?
    - How do we construct our design to "allow it to be efficiently and effectively extended"?

7. What is Model-View-Controller? Illustrate how you have utilized this idea in your solution. That is, use it!
8. Different articles describe MVC differently; are you using pattern Composite?, Observer?, Strategy? How are your
   views and controllers organized? What is your working definition of MVC?
9. Iterators -- are they required for this problem? Fully explain your answer!


Your system must be completed by the due time and must be ready for demonstration in the practical session. In addition to that, you are also required to hand-in:

1. A detailed rational for your augmented decisions with regard to the above design questions.
2. A copy of the code.
3. A list of known errors, faults, defects, missing functionality, etc ... telling us about your system's limitations
   will score better than letting us find them!

Please hand in all components and hence all sub-components by definition must be machine readable. In addition:

- The Subject Line should be in a specific format – Name and Student Id.
- File types should be only .pdf or .java for code.
- File names for code should be in Java format (all lower cases, with words concatenated with a dash)
- There must be a primary executable file that is the main entry for other codes. This has to have the format:
  "`project_main.java`". This main file should also contain a comment section with and some description of the runtime
  requirement of the code (e.g. command-line activation format).
